Elon Musk controls ventures like Tesla and xAI. Reports indicate xAI is building a supercomputer with about 100,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs. Each H100 can perform roughly 4×10⁵ TOPS of int8 operations, so the cluster would reach around 4×10²⁰ int8 ops per second.[^1][^2]

As an oligarch, Musk ultimately decides how this compute is used, leaving a single stakeholder.
