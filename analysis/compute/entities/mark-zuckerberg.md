## Description
Mark Zuckerberg controls Meta and its AI infrastructure.

## Scope
- Meta's AI Research SuperCluster uses 16,000 NVIDIA A100 GPUs providing roughly
  1e+19 dense INT8 operations per second.[^1][^2]
- Zuckerberg holds majority voting power at Meta, controlling about 51% of the
  company.[^3]

The combined resources yield at least 1e+19 dense INT8 operations per second.

## Implications
Zuckerberg's control centralizes vast compute resources under a single
individual, concentrating decision-making and increasing the risks associated
with unchecked deployment of powerful AI systems. This centralization also
enables rapid development and experimentation at global scale.
