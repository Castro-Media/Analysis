## Description
Mark Zuckerberg controls Meta and its AI infrastructure.

## Scope
- Meta deployed a training cluster with 24,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs to support Llama 3, providing roughly 5×10^19 dense INT8 operations per second.[^1][^2]
- Meta plans to purchase up to 350,000 H100 GPUs, which would raise future capacity substantially.[^3]
- Zuckerberg holds majority voting power at Meta, controlling about 51% of the company.[^4]

Total compute: about 5×10^19 dense INT8 operations per second under his direction.

## Implications
Zuckerberg's control centralizes vast compute resources under a single individual, concentrating decision-making and increasing the risks associated with unchecked deployment of powerful AI systems. This centralization also enables rapid development and experimentation at global scale.
