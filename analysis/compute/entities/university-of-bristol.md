## Description
The University of Bristol hosts the Isambard-AI supercomputer to support UK researchers.

## Scope
- Isambard-AI uses 5,448 NVIDIA GH200 superchips and delivers about 21 exaFLOPS of AI performance (~2×10^19 dense INT8 operations per second).[^1]
- Earlier Isambard systems provide additional, smaller capacity.

Total compute: around 2×10^19 dense INT8 operations per second.

## Implications
This infrastructure positions the University of Bristol as a major hub for UK AI research, but also centralizes significant compute within a single academic institution.
