The Government of Japan coordinates national supercomputing through agencies such as
RIKEN and the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology.
RIKEN's Fugaku system delivers about 0.442 exaFLOPS of FP64 performance, equivalent to
roughly 3.5×10¹⁸ dense INT8 operations per second.[^1]
AIST's ABCI 2.0 cluster adds additional capacity for academic and industrial research.[^2]

Together these state resources provide on the order of four exaflops of INT8 compute.
Governance spans MEXT, RIKEN, AIST, and partner universities, involving around 200
stakeholders.
