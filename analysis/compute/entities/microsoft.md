## Description
Microsoft operates Azure, a global cloud platform providing large-scale GPU clusters for internal and customer AI workloads.

## Scope
- Reports indicate Microsoft acquired around 150,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs for Azure AI and OpenAI workloads, offering on the order of 1×10^20 dense INT8 operations per second.[^1][^2]
- Additional GPUs across Azure regions and classified government clouds further expand capacity.

Overall, Microsoft's accessible AI compute is roughly 1×10^20 dense INT8 operations per second.

## Implications
This scale allows Microsoft to serve commercial customers and partners like OpenAI, but concentrates critical AI infrastructure under one corporation.
