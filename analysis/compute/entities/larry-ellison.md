## Description
Larry Ellison co-founded Oracle and serves as executive chairman.
He directs Oracle's plan for a supercomputer using about 26,000
NVIDIA H100 GPUs, enabling roughly 5×10^19 dense INT8 operations
per second.[^1][^2]

## Scope
- Oracle announced plans for a supercomputer using about
  26,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs, yielding roughly 5×10^19 dense INT8
  operations per second.[^1][^2]
- Oracle operates additional data centers, but accessible compute
  figures are limited.

Total compute: 5×10^19 dense INT8 operations per second.

## Implications
Ellison's control over Oracle's cloud resources positions him to
shape enterprise AI development. Concentrating these capabilities in
a single stakeholder raises questions about oversight, yet it also
enables rapid experimentation and services for Oracle's customers.
