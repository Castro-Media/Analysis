## Description
The Government of India oversees national high-performance computing through the National Supercomputing Mission.

## Scope
- As of 2025 the mission operates 34 supercomputers delivering 35 PFLOPS of FP64 performance, equivalent to roughly 3×10^17 INT8 operations per second.[^1]
- The AIRAWAT initiative is building an AI supercomputing platform targeting hundreds of petaflops for future deployments.[^2]

These resources yield about 3×10^17 dense INT8 operations per second today.

## Implications
Modernized compute supports scientific research and digital public services, though broader expansion is needed to meet India's population-scale ambitions.
