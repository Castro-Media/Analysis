India's National Supercomputing Mission operates systems such as **Pratyush** and **Aaditya**.
These deliver roughly ten petaflops combined, or about 1×10¹⁶ int8 operations per second.[^1][^2]

The machines support weather, climate, and national research programs across agencies.
This puts about one hundred stakeholders in a position to direct their use.
