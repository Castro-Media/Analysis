Reports indicate Apple is assembling an "Ajax" training cluster with roughly 3,600 Nvidia H100 GPUs to support generative AI work. With each H100 capable of ~4×10^14 INT8 operations per second, the cluster would supply about 1.4×10^18 INT8 ops per second, rounded here to 2×10^18.[^1]

Apple's board and senior leadership—about a dozen people—govern how this compute is used.
