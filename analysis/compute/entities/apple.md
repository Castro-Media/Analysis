Reports indicate Apple plans to purchase 2,000–3,000 AI servers in 2024, each with eight NVIDIA H100 GPUs, for 16,000–24,000 GPUs in total. With each H100 delivering about 1.979×10¹⁵ dense INT8 ops, this yields roughly 3–5×10¹⁹ operations per second.[^1]

Apple's board and senior leadership—about a dozen people—govern how this compute is used.
