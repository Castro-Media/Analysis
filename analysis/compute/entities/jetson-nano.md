## Description

The NVIDIA Jetson Nano is an entry-level edge AI module for hobbyist robotics and embedded projects.
It offers modest compute power in a compact, affordable form factor accessible to individuals.

## Scope

A single Jetson Nano provides roughly 2×10^13 dense INT8 operations per second (≈20 INT8 TOPS).

**Total compute:** 2×10^13 INT8 operations per second.

## Implications

The module enables experimentation with vision and robotics on personal budgets, but
its limited throughput restricts model size and real-time performance.
Individuals can prototype edge AI applications yet must optimize carefully.
