A consumer desktop with a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 graphics card can deliver roughly 1×10^16 dense INT8 operations per second. NVIDIA quotes about 1,321 INT8 TOPS with 2:4 sparsity; removing sparsity and using the 1 MAC = 2 ops rule places the card in this order‑of‑magnitude range.[^1]

With only one owner/operator, the stakeholder count is one.
