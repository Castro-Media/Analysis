A consumer desktop with a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 graphics card can deliver roughly 1.3×10¹⁵ dense INT8 operations per second. NVIDIA quotes 1,321 INT8 TOPS with 2:4 sparsity; halving for density and applying the 1 MAC = 2 ops rule yields this figure.[^1]

With only one owner/operator, the stakeholder count is one.
