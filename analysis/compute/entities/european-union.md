The EuroHPC Joint Undertaking coordinates EU-wide investments in high-performance
computing. Pre-exascale systems such as LUMI in Finland (309 PFLOPS), LEONARDO in Italy
(174 PFLOPS), and MareNostrum 5 in Spain (314 PFLOPS) are operational, while Germany's
forthcoming JUPITER aims for 1 exaflop.[^1][^2][^3][^4]

Aggregating these capacities yields about 1.8 exaflops of FP64 peak performance, which
corresponds to roughly 1.4×10¹⁹ dense INT8 operations per second using an 8× width
scaling.

Governance spans the European Commission and representatives from each member state,
for roughly 100 stakeholders.
