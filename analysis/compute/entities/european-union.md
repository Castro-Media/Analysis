## Description
The European Union funds and coordinates large shared supercomputers through the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking.

## Scope
- Pre-exascale systems like LUMI (309 PFLOPS), LEONARDO (174 PFLOPS), and MareNostrum 5 (314 PFLOPS) provide significant baseline capacity.[^1][^2][^3]
- In 2025 the JUPITER exascale computer came online in Germany, adding roughly 8×10^18 INT8 operations per second.[^4]

These resources total about 2×10^19 dense INT8 operations per second.

## Implications
Expanded compute supports European research and industrial projects while reducing reliance on foreign cloud providers, but it also raises questions about equitable access among member states.
