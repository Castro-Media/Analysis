The People's Republic of China operates a network of national supercomputing centers.
Systems in the Sunway line, such as Sunway TaihuLight and the exascale Sunway Oceanlite
prototype, deliver multiple exaflops of peak performance.[^1][^2] The Tianhe series,
including Tianhe-2A in Guangzhou and the forthcoming Tianhe-3, adds further capacity.[^3]

Combined, these state-run machines provide roughly ten exaflops of dense INT8 performance
(≈1×10¹⁹ operations per second). Governance of these resources sits within ministries
under the State Council and provincial partners, involving about 500 stakeholders.[^4]
