## Description
The People's Republic of China operates a national network of supercomputing facilities supporting research, industry, and military applications.

## Scope
- Sunway centers host systems such as Sunway TaihuLight and the exascale Sunway Oceanlite prototype, providing multiple exaflops of throughput.[^1][^2]
- The Tianhe line, including Tianhe-2A in Guangzhou and the forthcoming Tianhe-3, expands capacity across the national supercomputing infrastructure.[^3]
- Additional provincial and ministerial facilities contribute petascale resources under the supervision of the Ministry of Science and Technology.[^4]

Combined, these state-run machines provide roughly 1Ã—10^19 dense INT8 operations per second. Further data is needed to quantify the numerous regional centers beyond the major Sunway and Tianhe systems.

## Implications
China's broad supercomputing deployment underpins domestic AI research and high-performance computing, enhancing technological autonomy while raising geopolitical competition concerns. Control over significant compute also supports advanced surveillance and military modernization.
