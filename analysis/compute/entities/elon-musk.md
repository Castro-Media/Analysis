Elon Musk controls ventures like Tesla and xAI. Reports indicate xAI is building a supercomputer with about 100,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs. Each H100 performs roughly 1.979×10¹⁵ dense INT8 ops per second, so the cluster would reach around 4×10²⁰ operations.[^1][^2]

As an oligarch, Musk ultimately decides how this compute is used, leaving a single stakeholder.
