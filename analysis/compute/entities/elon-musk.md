## Description
Elon Musk controls ventures such as Tesla, SpaceX, and xAI.

## Scope
- xAI is building a supercomputer with roughly 100,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs delivering about 2×10^20 dense INT8 operations per second.[^1][^2]
- Tesla develops the Dojo supercomputer, expected to reach around 2×10^18 INT8 operations per second when fully deployed.[^3]
- Tesla and SpaceX also maintain conventional GPU clusters and HPC resources for vehicle training and rocket simulations, though public compute figures are scarce.

Combined, Musk-controlled projects provide at least 2×10^20 dense INT8 operations per second from the xAI cluster alone. Further data is needed to quantify Tesla and SpaceX resources.

## Implications
Musk's centralized control over large-scale compute enables rapid development of proprietary AI systems but concentrates power and decision-making in a single individual, raising concerns around oversight and misuse. At the same time, this infrastructure can accelerate technological innovation across automotive, aerospace, and AI industries.
