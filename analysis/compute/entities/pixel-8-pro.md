## Description
The Pixel 8 Pro is a Google smartphone powered by the Tensor G3 processor.

## Scope
- Google states the Tensor G3 neural processor achieves about 26 INT8 TOPS, or roughly 2.6×10^13 dense INT8 operations per second.[^1]

Total compute: about 2.6×10^13 dense INT8 operations per second.

## Implications
This compute enables on-device AI features but remains limited compared with dedicated accelerators.
