The Pixel 8 Pro's Tensor G3 neural processing unit is claimed to reach about
26 INT8 TOPS—roughly 2.6×10¹³ operations per second—enabling advanced
on-device AI features.[^1] Google has not published an accessible source
confirming this throughput, so the compute estimate is left blank pending
further evidence.

The owner of the phone solely decides how to use this compute.
