The Russian Federation operates supercomputing facilities across academic, industrial, and government sectors. Systems such as
Moscow State University's Lomonosov-2 and Sberbank's Christofari networks collectively deliver roughly two hundred petaflops of
FP16 performance, translating to about two times ten to the seventeenth dense INT8 operations per second after conversion.

Governance over these machines spans federal agencies, state corporations, and research institutions, involving an estimated two
hundred fifty stakeholders.
