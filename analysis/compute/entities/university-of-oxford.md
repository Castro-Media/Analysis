## Description
The University of Oxford operates the Advanced Research Computing facility and participates in UK national GPU programs.

## Scope
- The ARC cluster provides about 1 PFLOP of FP64 performance (~8×10^15 INT8 operations per second).[^1]
- Additional AI resources may exist through national initiatives such as JADE2, but public figures are limited.

Total compute: about 8×10^15 dense INT8 operations per second. Further research is needed to catalog other resources.

## Implications
Reliable compute supports university research, yet the lack of transparent figures hinders assessment of Oxford's AI capacity.
