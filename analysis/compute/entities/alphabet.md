Alphabet runs large TPU clusters that support Google services and research at scale. Eight TPU v4 pods provide about 9 exaFLOPS of bfloat16 throughput, and a TPU v5p pod adds roughly 4.5 exaFLOPS. Converted to dense INT8 with the 2× rule, this places Alphabet near 2×10¹⁹ operations per second.[^1]

Roughly fifteen senior executives and board members ultimately direct how this infrastructure is used.
