## Description
Alphabet runs Google's global AI hardware, including GPUs and TPUs for search and cloud services.

## Scope
- Reports indicate Google purchased about 50,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs for AI workloads, providing roughly 1×10^20 dense INT8 operations per second when combined.[^1][^2]
- Google Cloud continues deploying TPU v4 and v5p pods to support research and products.[^3]

Combined, these resources yield about 1×10^20 dense INT8 operations per second.

## Implications
Alphabet's expanding compute allows it to train advanced models for search, advertising, and cloud offerings, but it concentrates substantial resources within a single corporation.
