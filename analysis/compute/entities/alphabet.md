Alphabet runs large TPU and GPU clusters that support Google services and research at scale. Public disclosures around TPU v4 and v5 pods suggest that, aggregated across thousands of chips, Alphabet controls on the order of 10^20 dense INT8 operations per second.[^1]

Roughly fifteen senior executives and board members ultimately direct how this infrastructure is used.
