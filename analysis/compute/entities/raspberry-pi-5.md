A Raspberry Pi 5 with its integrated VideoCore VII GPU is sometimes said to deliver about 20 GFLOPS FP32, which would convert to roughly 0.08 INT8 TOPS (about 8×10¹⁰ ops) using the 4× FP32→INT8 rule.[^1] This performance figure has not been confirmed by an accessible source, so the compute estimate remains blank.

With only one owner or operator, the number of stakeholders is one.
