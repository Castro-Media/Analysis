## Description

The Raspberry Pi 5 is a single-board computer for hobbyists and educators.
Its VideoCore VII GPU offers basic AI acceleration in a low-cost form factor.
Ownership is typically personal, so a single stakeholder controls the board.

## Scope

A Raspberry Pi 5 delivers roughly 6×10^12 dense INT8 operations per second
(≈6 INT8 TOPS).[^1]

**Total compute:** 6×10^12 INT8 operations per second.

## Implications

The board's modest throughput limits it to lightweight edge models.
Its affordability lets individuals explore AI workloads, yet performance ceilings
remain tight.
