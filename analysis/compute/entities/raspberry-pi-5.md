A Raspberry Pi 5 with its integrated VideoCore VII GPU delivers roughly 1×10^11 dense INT8 operations per second. Raspberry Pi's documentation lists about 20 GFLOPS FP32 for the GPU, which converts to about 0.08 INT8 TOPS using the 4× FP32→INT8 rule, keeping it below 0.1 TOPS[^1].

With only one owner or operator, the stakeholder count is one.
