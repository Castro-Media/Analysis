Samsung's Galaxy S24 Ultra integrates the Exynos 2400 NPU, which is rumored to deliver roughly 45 INT8 TOPS—about 4.5×10¹³ operations per second.[^1] This claim lacks a publicly accessible citation, so the compute value remains unspecified until verified.

The device's owner controls how this compute is used.
