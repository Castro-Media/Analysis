## Description
The United Kingdom funds national supercomputers through UK Research and Innovation.

## Scope
- ARCHER2 provides about 1.6×10^17 dense INT8 operations per second for national research programs.[^1]
- Smaller government clusters add modest capacity.

Total compute: roughly 2×10^17 dense INT8 operations per second.

## Implications
Large-scale government clusters aim to support domestic AI research but require careful governance to balance open access with national security.
