The United Kingdom maintains national high-performance computing assets through UK Research and
Innovation. ARCHER2, the country's flagship system, peaks around 19.5 PFLOPS FP64, translating to
roughly 1.6×10^17 dense INT8 operations per second when using the 8× bit-width heuristic.[^1]
Additional clusters across government agencies and research councils bring the total to an estimated
2×10^17 operations per second. Governance of these resources spans research councils and Whitehall
departments, for an estimated 100 stakeholders.[^2]
