The United States federal government controls compute across multiple agencies. The Department of Energy operates exascale systems like the Frontier (1.1×10¹⁸ int8 ops/s) and Aurora (>2×10¹⁸ int8 ops/s) supercomputers.[^1][^2] The National Security Agency runs datacenters estimated near an exaflop,[^3] while the Department of Defense and NASA maintain additional petascale resources.[^4]

Aggregating these capacities yields roughly five exaflops (≈5×10¹⁸ int8 operations per second) available to the federal government.

Decision making over these resources spans the executive branch, Congress, and independent agencies, resulting in an estimated 600 stakeholders.
