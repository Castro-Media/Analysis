## Description
The United States federal government oversees extensive supercomputing resources across civilian and defense agencies.

## Scope
- Department of Energy systems include Frontier (~8.8×10^18 INT8 ops/s), Aurora (>1.6×10^19), and the forthcoming El Capitan (~1.6×10^19), alongside legacy machines like Summit (~1.6×10^18) and Sierra (~1×10^18).[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5]
- Intelligence and defense bodies operate large data centers such as the NSA's Utah facility (~8×10^18) and DoD's High Performance Computing Modernization Program (~3.8×10^17).[^6][^7]
- Civil agencies maintain additional capacity: NOAA's weather forecasting machines (≈1.9×10^17) and NASA's Aitken and Pleiades clusters (≈1.3×10^17), with other departments procuring cloud resources for analytics.[^8][^9]
- Cloud contracts with providers like AWS and Microsoft make additional tens of exaflops accessible to federal agencies.[^10][^11]

Summing these sources places federal compute near 1×10^20 dense INT8 operations per second. Further study is required to capture smaller agency clusters.

## Implications
Control of massive compute gives the U.S. government significant leverage in scientific research, national security, and weather prediction, but centralization raises oversight questions and the risk of dual-use military applications.
