The California State University system maintains shared research compute such as a 100‑GPU V100 cluster at San Diego State University. Each V100 performs about 1.25×10^14 INT8 operations per second, yielding roughly 1.3×10^16 INT8 ops across the system.[^1]

Given oversight across 23 campuses and the Chancellor's Office, about 200 stakeholders participate in compute decisions.
